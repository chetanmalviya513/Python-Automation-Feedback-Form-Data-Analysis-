📊 Case Study: Automating Feedback Form Data Analysis using Python

🔍 Problem Statement

This case study focuses on automating the feedback data analysis process for an institute that offers multiple online courses. After each course, participants fill out a standardized feedback form containing multiple-choice questions related to faculty skills, course usefulness, and the adequacy of provided materials.

Previously, analyzing this feedback manually in MS Excel took up to 4 hours per batch. The repetitive nature of the task, combined with the structured yet qualitative data, created inefficiencies and consumed valuable technical staff time.

To resolve this, a Python-based automation system was developed. The system:

Imports feedback CSV files

Filters and cleans data

Converts qualitative responses (like "Very Effective") to quantitative scores

Transposes data for faculty-wise analysis

Calculates average ratings

Visualizes the results using bar graphs

The project was managed using the Critical Path Method (CPM) to ensure step-by-step execution and scheduling. Major challenges included transforming subjective responses into analyzable metrics and handling row-column realignment. With the help of libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, the entire process was automated—cutting down analysis time drastically and improving accuracy.

🎯 Objective
To automate the data processing, analysis, and visualization of feedback form responses using Python, reducing human effort, minimizing errors, and speeding up insights generation.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas – Data Cleaning & Transformation

Matplotlib – Data Visualization

Critical Path Method – For project task planning

Excel/CSV – Data Input/Output

🚀 Project Workflow

Step 1: 📅 Project Schedule Planning
Defined project stages using Critical Path Method and visualized using a Gantt Chart.

Step 2: 📥 Importing Feedback Data
Imported response .csv files generated from Google Forms using pandas.

Step 3: 🔍 Data Filtering
Filtered relevant data by skill categories:
Communication, Quality, Competency, Usefulness

Step 4: 🔄 Data Transformation
Converted qualitative ratings (e.g., "Very Effective") to quantitative scores (e.g., 5) using replace().

Step 5: 🔃 Row-Column Transposition
Used transpose() to reformat the dataset for easier aggregation by faculty.

Step 6: 📊 Faculty Rating Calculation
Calculated average ratings for each faculty across different skill metrics.

Step 7: 📈 Data Visualization
Used Matplotlib to visualize:

Faculty-wise average ratings

Feedback question responses (as % bars)

📁 Outputs
Cleaned .csv files with calculated metrics

Visual bar charts for quick insights

Excel exports for sharing

✅ Key Highlights
Reduced 4+ hour manual process to minutes

100% automated via Python scripting

Easily extendable to other course batches or forms
