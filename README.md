📊 Case Study: Automating Feedback Form Data Analysis Using Python

🔍 Problem Statement

An educational institute offering online courses collects standardized feedback from participants after each course. The feedback form includes multiple-choice questions evaluating faculty skills, course usefulness, and the availability of materials.

Until now, data analysis was conducted manually using MS Excel—a repetitive and time-consuming process that took up to 4 hours per batch. With every course having identical feedback forms, this manual work created inefficiencies and drained technical staff resources.

To tackle this, a Python-based automation system was developed to streamline the entire workflow—from data import to visualization.

🎯 Objective
Automate the data processing, analysis, and visualization of feedback form responses using Python to:

Save time

Minimize human error

Generate actionable insights faster

Eliminate repetitive manual tasks

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas – Data cleaning, filtering, transformation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Excel/CSV – Input/output format

Critical Path Method (CPM) – Project scheduling and planning

🚀 Project Workflow

Step 1: 📅 Project Planning
Used Critical Path Method (CPM) and Gantt charts to define, sequence, and schedule project tasks.

Step 2: 📥 Import Feedback Data
Downloaded .csv files from Google Forms and imported them using pandas.

Step 3: 🔍 Data Filtering
Extracted relevant skill-based feedback:

Step 4: 🔄 Data Transformation
Converted qualitative values like "Very Effective" to numeric scores (e.g., 5) using replace().

Step 5: 🔃 Row-Column Transposition
Used transpose() to restructure data for faculty-wise aggregation.

Step 6: 📊 Faculty Rating Calculation
Calculated average skill ratings per faculty using sum() and custom formulas.

Step 7: 📈 Visualization
Generated:

Bar graphs of faculty ratings

Percentage-based analysis of feedback questions using Matplotlib

📁 Outputs
Cleaned and transformed .csv files

Faculty-wise performance charts

Exportable Excel files

Visual insights for decision-making

✅ Key Highlights
⏱️ Reduced 4-hour manual effort to a few minutes

🧠 100% automated using Python scripts

🔁 Easily scalable across future course batches

📊 Clear visual reporting for stakeholders
