📊 Case Study: Automating Feedback Form Data Analysis using Python

🔍 Problem Statement

An institute conducting online courses collects structured feedback from participants. This includes ratings on faculty skills, course usefulness, material sufficiency, and more. Data analysis was previously manual using Excel, consuming ~4 hours per session.

🎯 Objective
To automate the data processing, analysis, and visualization of feedback form responses using Python, reducing human effort, minimizing errors, and speeding up insights generation.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas – Data Cleaning & Transformation

Matplotlib – Data Visualization

Critical Path Method – For project task planning

Excel/CSV – Data Input/Output

🚀 Project Workflow
Step 1: 📅 Project Schedule Planning
Defined project stages using Critical Path Method and visualized using a Gantt Chart.

Step 2: 📥 Importing Feedback Data
Imported response .csv files generated from Google Forms using pandas.

Step 3: 🔍 Data Filtering
Filtered relevant data by skill categories:
Communication, Quality, Competency, Usefulness

Step 4: 🔄 Data Transformation
Converted qualitative ratings (e.g., "Very Effective") to quantitative scores (e.g., 5) using replace().

Step 5: 🔃 Row-Column Transposition
Used transpose() to reformat the dataset for easier aggregation by faculty.

Step 6: 📊 Faculty Rating Calculation
Calculated average ratings for each faculty across different skill metrics.

Step 7: 📈 Data Visualization
Used Matplotlib to visualize:

Faculty-wise average ratings

Feedback question responses (as % bars)

📁 Outputs
Cleaned .csv files with calculated metrics

Visual bar charts for quick insights

Excel exports for sharing

✅ Key Highlights
Reduced 4+ hour manual process to minutes

100% automated via Python scripting

Easily extendable to other course batches or forms
